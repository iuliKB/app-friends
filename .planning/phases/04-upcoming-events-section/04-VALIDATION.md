# Phase 4 — Validation Strategy

> Per-phase validation contract for feedback sampling during execution.

---

## Test Infrastructure

| Property | Value |
|----------|-------|
| **Framework** | jest 29.x |
| **Config file** | jest.config.js |
| **Quick run command** | `npx jest --testPathPattern=upcoming` |
| **Full suite command** | `npx jest` |
| **Estimated runtime** | ~15 seconds |

---

## Sampling Rate

- **After every task commit:** Run `npx jest --testPathPattern=upcoming`
- **After every plan wave:** Run `npx jest`
- **Before `/gsd-verify-work`:** Full suite must be green
- **Max feedback latency:** 15 seconds

## Per-Task Verification Map

| Task ID | Plan | Wave | Requirement | Threat Ref | Secure Behavior | Test Type | Automated Command | File Exists | Status |
|---------|------|------|-------------|------------|-----------------|-----------|-------------------|-------------|--------|
| TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | — | N/A | TBD | TBD | ❌ W0 | ⬜ pending |

*Status: ⬜ pending · ✅ green · ❌ red · ⚠️ flaky*

---

## Wave 0 Requirements

- [ ] Test stubs for upcoming events section components
- [ ] Test stubs for image upload utilities

*Existing infrastructure covers framework setup.*

---

## Manual-Only Verifications

| Behavior | Requirement | Why Manual | Test Instructions |
|----------|-------------|------------|-------------------|
| Horizontal scroll snap on event cards | D-01 | Device-specific scroll physics | Scroll event cards horizontally on iOS/Android, verify snap to card boundaries |
| Image picker launches and returns image | D-15 | Requires device photo library access | Tap cover image picker, select photo, verify preview appears |
| Cover image displays on event card | D-02 | Visual verification of overlay/legibility | Create plan with cover image, verify card shows image with dark overlay |

---

## Validation Sign-Off

- [ ] All tasks have `<automated>` verify or Wave 0 dependencies
- [ ] Sampling continuity: no 3 consecutive tasks without automated verify
- [ ] Wave 0 covers all MISSING references
- [ ] No watch-mode flags
- [ ] Feedback latency < 15s
- [ ] `nyquist_compliant: true` set in frontmatter

**Approval:** pending
