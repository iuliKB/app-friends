# Campfire

## What This Is

Campfire is a "friendship OS" — an all-in-one social coordination app for close friend groups of 3–15 people. It combines availability status, event planning, group chat, and lightweight expense tracking into a single React Native + Expo mobile app backed by Supabase. V1 shipped with auth, friends, realtime status, quick plans, chat, and push notifications.

## Core Value

The daily availability status ("Free / Busy / Maybe") drives daily active use and makes it effortless for friends to see who's around and spin up spontaneous plans. If nothing else works, this must.

## Requirements

### Validated

- ✓ Auth flow with email/password, Google OAuth, and Apple Sign-In — v1.0
- ✓ Profile creation (username, display name, avatar) — v1.0
- ✓ Session persistence across app restarts — v1.0
- ✓ Friend system (add by username, QR code, accept/reject requests) — v1.0
- ✓ Daily status toggle (Free/Busy/Maybe) with emoji context tags — v1.0
- ✓ "Who's Free" home screen with realtime updates — v1.0
- ✓ Quick Plan creation (title, time, location, invite friends) — v1.0
- ✓ Plan dashboard with RSVP, link dump, IOU notes — v1.0
- ✓ Chat system (plan group chats + DMs) with realtime messaging — v1.0
- ✓ Profile editing and settings — v1.0
- ✓ Push notifications for plan invites — v1.0
- ✓ Squad Goals "Coming soon" stub tab — v1.0
- ✓ Seed data for development — v1.0
- ✓ 5-tab navigation (Home, Plans, Chat, Squad, Profile) — v1.0
- ✓ Supabase RLS on every table — v1.0
- ✓ Empty states and loading indicators on all screens — v1.0

### Active

<!-- v1.1 — UI/UX Design System & Consistency -->

- [ ] Design system extracted from reference views (Plans, Chats)
- [ ] Color constants used consistently across all screens
- [ ] Spacing scale applied uniformly (screen padding, sections, components)
- [ ] Typography scale standardized
- [ ] Reusable shared components (FAB, form inputs, error displays, loading/empty states)
- [ ] Pull-to-refresh pattern on all list views
- [ ] Consistent view title treatment across all screens

## Current Milestone: v1.1 UI/UX Design System

**Goal:** Extract a design system from the best v1.0 screens and apply it consistently across the entire app, creating a solid foundation for future views.

**Target features:**
- Design tokens (colors, spacing, typography, radii) extracted from Plans and Chats reference views
- Shared component library (FAB, inputs, errors, loading, empty states)
- All screens refactored to use design system
- Pull-to-refresh standardized on list views

### Out of Scope

- Interactive social map — V2 feature, high complexity
- Calendar sync — V2, requires native calendar APIs
- OCR receipt scanning — V2, needs camera + ML
- Venue booking / B2B integrations — V3
- AI social suggestions — V3
- Media/image sharing in chat — V2
- Read receipts, message reactions — V2
- Public profiles or discoverability — friends-only by design
- Web app / PWA — mobile only
- Group size pagination — unnecessary for 3–15 person groups

## Context

Shipped v1.0 MVP with 9,322 LOC TypeScript across 6 phases in 7 days.
Tech stack: React Native + Expo (managed workflow), TypeScript strict, Supabase (Postgres + Auth + Realtime + Storage), Zustand.
All 55 v1 requirements delivered. 145 commits, 221 files.

Known technical considerations:
- Apple Sign-In works in Expo Go but needs validation on EAS builds
- Supabase free-tier Realtime limited to 200 concurrent connections
- Push notifications require EAS development build for remote push on Android
- Nudge mechanic deferred to v2 (DM infrastructure covers the use case)

## Constraints

- **Tech stack:** React Native + Expo (managed workflow), TypeScript strict, Supabase, Zustand — non-negotiable
- **Expo Go:** Every library must work in Expo Go managed workflow without custom native modules
- **No backend server:** All server logic via Supabase RPC functions (Postgres)
- **No UI libraries:** React Native StyleSheet only
- **No Redux, React Query:** Zustand for state. Direct Supabase queries in hooks
- **TypeScript strict:** `"strict": true`, `"noUncheckedIndexedAccess": true`. No `any`
- **RLS is security:** Never rely on client-side filtering
- **UUIDs everywhere:** No sequential integer IDs exposed
- **Free tier budget:** 500MB DB, 1GB Storage, 50K MAU, 2M Realtime messages/month
- **Chat text-only in V1:** No images, files, reactions, read receipts
- **FlatList for all lists:** No ScrollView + map

## Key Decisions

| Decision | Rationale | Outcome |
|----------|-----------|---------|
| Supabase over Firebase | Single SDK for Postgres, Auth, Realtime, Storage. Free tier generous. | ✓ Good |
| Zustand over Redux | Lightweight, no boilerplate. Only for ephemeral UI state. | ✓ Good |
| Expo managed workflow | Expo Go testing without dev accounts. Platform-agnostic. | ✓ Good |
| Email + Google + Apple OAuth from Phase 1 | All auth methods available from day one | ✓ Good |
| Status defaults to "Maybe" | Prevents false "free" signals, prompts curiosity | ✓ Good |
| least()/greatest() for symmetric relationships | Prevents duplicate friendship/DM pairs | ✓ Good |
| Seed data in seed.sql | Pre-loaded test users for faster dev iteration | ✓ Good |
| Stack.Protected session guards | Clean route-level auth without manual redirects | ✓ Good |
| Server confirmation for status updates | Wait for Supabase response before updating local state | ✓ Good |
| Single Realtime channel with user_id filter | Stays within 200 connection limit vs. per-friend channels | ✓ Good |
| Optimistic send with 5s dedup for chat | Instant UX while preventing duplicate messages | ✓ Good |
| AsyncStorage notification toggle | Per-device preference, default enabled | ✓ Good |
